**Melissa (Mel) Pavlik is a PhD candidate in Political Science at [Yale University](https://politicalscience.yale.edu/people/melissa-pavlik)** researching how states work with non-state allies to coerce and control vulnerable populations, especially in West Africa. Her interests include the political economy and geography of informality, enforcement patterns, and mapping the micro-dynamics of repression and political violence. She also works on issues of causal inference and measurement, particularly data missingness, spatial networks, and the use of fine-grained geographic and satellite data. Her dissertation project focuses on how states use uneven enforcement patterns to `produce precarity' among populations displaced by conflict and climate change, fostering their exploitation by powerful allies. This project features insight from fieldwork in Lagos, Nigeria. Her [academic work](http://www.melissapavlik.com/publications/) has been published in [International Security](mjpavlik.github.io/_publications/2021_opportunistic-repression).

Before graduate school, Mel spent years mapping and analyzing data on political violence for NGOs, conflict observatories, and think tanks, including most recently at the [Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED)](https://acleddata.com/author/melissa-pavlik/). Her analysis has been published across a wide variety of outlets, including [The Washington Post's Monkey Cage](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/31/autocratic-governments-are-using-covid-19-pretext-clamp-down-opponents/), [World Politics Review](https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/author/mel-pavlik/), and [Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/author/mel-pavlik/).
