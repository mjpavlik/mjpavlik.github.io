  This course provides an overview of game theory and its applications to political science. We start from the ground floor, assuming no prior exposure to game theory or mathematics beyond high school algebra. Students are introduced to game theoretic concepts such as Nash equilibrium, subgame perfection, and signaling. These concepts can be applied to examine a variety of political phenomena, including candidate competition, fund-raising, political posturing, and executive-legislative
bargaining. While most of the applications of game theory that we explore will be political in nature,
some of our applications will be drawn from the world of economics and every-day life.responsibilities: >
