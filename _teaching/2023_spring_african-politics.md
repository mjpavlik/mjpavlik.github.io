description: >
  The purpose of this class is to introduce students to some of the major questions in the study of African politics. Throughout the course of the semester, we will engage with the following questions: How do pre-colonial and colonial institutions shape current politics? What explains the political institutions and development strategies that were adopted after independence? Have competitive elections led to accountable governments? Why have some African governments experienced civil war and how can civil conflict be resolved? How much influence do international actors and China in particular have in Africa? The focus of the course is on countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The course provides a broad overview of diverse topics and countries, emphasizing breadth. The assignments provide an opportunity for students to add depth to their knowledge of particular countries of their choosing. In addition to giving students the opportunity to learn more about politics in contemporary sub-Saharan Africa, the course will provide students with experience testing social scientific theories against empirical evidence, conducting original research using primary and secondary sources, and writing succinct research reports. Students will analyze issues of both academic and policy importance.
