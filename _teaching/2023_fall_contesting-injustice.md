description: >
  Why, when and how do ordinary people organize collectively to challenge political, social and economic injustice? We will analyze the conditions that lead ordinary people to organize to contest injustice, the various tactics and strategies of mobilization, the moral, political, and strategic dilemmas that activists face, and the conditions for success in altering the norms and institutions that sustain injustice. We will explore theoretical approaches to understanding mobilization against injustice, including those centered on self-interest, moral outrage, social preferences, social networks, political opportunity, and movement culture. Films that document the experience of injustice as well as the process of mobilization are an integral part of the course. Our focus will be on mobilization in both the US and international settings.
